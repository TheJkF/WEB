				<h1 class="TOS">License</h1>
				<p class="TOS">
				Your content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that
				you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative
				content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone
				else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.
				We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content.
				You provide Google with that permission through this license.</p>
				<h1 class="TOS">What’s covered</h1>
				<p class="TOS">This license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.</p>
				<h1 class="TOS">What’s not covered</h1>
				<p class="TOS">This license doesn’t affect your data protection rights — it’s only about your intellectual
				property rights</p>
				<h1 class="TOS">This license doesn’t cover these types of content:</h1>
				<p class="TOS">publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the
				address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s
				considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
				feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is
				covered in the Service-related communications section below.</p>
				<h1 class="TOS">Scope</h1>
				<p class="TOS">This license is:
				worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
				non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
				royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license</p>
				<h1 class="TOS">Rights</h1>
				<p class="TOS">This license allows Google to:
				host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save
				your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
				publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to
				others
				modify your content, such as reformatting or translating it
				sublicense these rights to:
				other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share
				photos with people you choose
				our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these
				terms, only for the limited purposes described in the Purpose section below</p>
				<h1 class="TOS">Purpose</h1>
				<p class="TOS">This license is for the limited purpose of:
				operating and improving the services, which means allowing the services to work as
				designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated
				systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
				for spam, malware, and illegal content
				to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album
				in Google Photos to keep related photos together
				to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and
				personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off
				in Ads Settings)
				This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
				using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services. For example, to promote
				a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might
				show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
				developing new technologies and services for Google consistent with these terms
				Duration
				This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.
				If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems
				will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two
				exceptions:
				If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you
				shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that
				photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it
				from your Google Account.
				If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that
				search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as
				part of their search results.
