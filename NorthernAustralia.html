			<h1>Northen Australia</h1>
			<p class="Description">The Northern Territory is an Australian territory in the central and central northern regions of Australia. To the north, the territory looks out to the Timor Sea, the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria, including Western New Guinea and other islands of the Indonesian archipelago. Known for having more than 25 national parks, it´s the perfect place to go if you are looking for beautiful landmarks and calm places. Don´t forget to be careful with the animals around as in Australia there are a lot of the most dangerous especies of snakes, spiders and scorpions. The Northern Territory's population is the youngest in Australia but also the smallest. The best way to visit this place is by renting a car as it has almost no buses and the railroad are almost empty caused by the lack of population in te region. Darwin is the largest city and also the capital of the region. There almos everyday of the year you have 30°C but with high humidity, it is said there are only two primay seasons one wet from October to April and one dry from May to September, even with that the lowest temperature ever recorded was 14°C and a frost has never been recorded. If you want to come here don´t expect to see it all in one go, as this territory is six time larger than Britain. If you are into mining you can visit their uranium mines as it is one of the biggest in the world, also the economy is largely driven by this sector. Last but not least it is a very touristic place so it´s easy to find some guides to take you around for a cheap price. </p>
